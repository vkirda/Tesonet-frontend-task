Programming languages such as Perl, Ruby, C, and Java support template processing either natively, or through add-on libraries and modules. 
JavaServer Pages (JSP), PHP, and Active Server Pages (ASP with VBScript, JScript or other languages) are examples, themselves, of web template 
engines. These technologies are typically used in server-side templating systems, but could be adapted for use on a "edge-side" proxy or for 
static page generation.
